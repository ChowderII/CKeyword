# CKeyword
C Keyword Extractor using TF/IDF

## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to learn how TF/IDF works, to gain experience in C and to help the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) to classify their blog posts by extracting their keywords automatically.

### Intended use
The intended use of this program is to generate relevant keywords based on PHAC Data Blogs and allow the department to use these keywords to optimise their search function on their website.

## Current stage
We have just created the project. The project is in its infancy. Research is being conducted to solidify the documentation and design of the program.
